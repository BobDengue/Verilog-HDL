# Verilog-HDL
Some Verilog Module May be used frequently
Last month , I was studying FPGA using XIlinx SPARTAN-6 in Verilog HDL 
I have create some useful modules may be used frequently especially i2c and spi communication module
however 
my boss order me to do another subject ,the power electronics
Therefore
I break from Verilog
But ! But ! But !
I'd like to release my code for no such code on github sadly
Becasuse my code is a litle dirty 
it cay costs my days to clean/clear it before i release it
All my code will be released no more than September the 1st
BTW:I still don't know how to use github actually
